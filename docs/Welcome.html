    <h1>Introducing CodeProject SenseAI</h1>
    <div style="margin: -15px 0 20px 0;"><code>Alpha 1.0</code></div>

    <p>Our standalone, self-hosted, fast, free and Open Source Artificial Intelligence microserver
        for any platform, any language.</p>

    <h2>To Get Started</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Setup the CodeProject SenseAI Server by double-clicking the
            <kbd>Setup_SenseAI_Win.bat</kbd> file. This only needs to be done once.
        </li>
        <li>Start the CodeProject SenseAI Server by double-clicking the 
        <kbd>Start_SenseAI_Win.bat</kbd> file</li>
        <li>Open the <a href="./demos/javascript/vision.html" style="font-weight:bold">CodeProject 
        SenseAI Playground</a> to explore the capabilities.</li>
    </ol>

    <div class="callout">
        This is a developer preview full of sharp edges and exciting ledges, but that's part of what
        makes this fun. <a href="https://github.com/codeproject/CodeProject.SenseAI">Explore the code</a>
        and try out the playground. We're looking for help, ideas, and feedback. If you know any 
        good AI modules we should include then please send in your suggestions.

    <h2>What is CodeProject SenseAI Server?</h2>

    <p>CodeProject SenseAI is a self contained server that allows other applications to easily
        include AI processing as part of their service. The service is a simple REST API based
        on HTTP that is fully self contained, can be installed locally, and requires no 
        off-device processing.</p>

    <h2>What does it include?</h2>

    <p>CodeProject SenseAI includes</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>A HTTP REST API Server</b>. The server listens for requests from other apps, 
            passes them to the backend analysis services for processing, and then passes the
            results back to the caller. It runs as a simple self contained web service on your
            device.</li>
        <li><b>Backend Analysis services</b>. The brains of the operation is in the analysis
            services sitting behind the front end API. All processing of data is done on the 
            current machine. No calls to the cloud and no data leaving the device.</li>
        <li><b>The Source Code</b>, naturally.
    </ul>

    <h2>What can it do?</h2>

    <p>CodeProject SenseAI can currently</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Detect objects in images</li>
        <li>Detect faces in images</li>
        <li>Detect the type of scene represented in an image</li>
        <li>Recognize faces that have been registered with the service</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will be constantly expanding the feature list.</p>

    <h2>Why CodeProject SenseAI</h2>

    <p>Because adding AI capabilities to your apps is annoyingly hard.</p>
    <p>We want AI development to be something every developer can access, and we want integrating 
        AI into applications to be straightforward.</p>
    <p>AI development involves a lot of digging into details that often lead to more questions than
        answers We don't want that. It often involves expensive cloud services, the requirement for
        your data to leave your network, and a certain level of lock-in to a given vendor. We feel
        that an AI library should should be</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Completely self contained</b>. No sign-in, no reliance on Cloud servers (though
            having the option is nice), nothing to download at runtime. Everything you need already
            in place. </li>
        <li><b>Safe and secure</b>. Data processed as part of the application logic should never
            leave the local environment unless you expressly allow it. Sending data to a cloud
            service solves a bunch of problems, but sometimes your data simply must stay in your
            own home or organisation. This is critical.</li>
        <li><b>Always open</b>. CodeProject is built on the concept of Open Source development and 
            CodeProject SenseAI is no different.</li>
        <li><b>Cross Platform</b> We don't often have the luxury of picking a single platform 
            anymore. There needs to be support for Windows, Linux, macOS, and Raspberry Pi to 
            name a few.</li>
        <li><b>Cross Architecture CPU and GPU support</b>, of course</li>
        <li><b>Fast and lightweight</b> Necessary for a self-contained distributable system, but
        if you have the power and space then we'll have options for you too.</li>
        <li><b>Extendable</b>. AI is expanding so rapidly, and there are so many wonderful 
            solutions popping up daily. Adding new capabilities must be as simple as dropping 
            in the code and registering the new capabilities with the front end server.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Goals</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To promote AI development and inspire the AI developer community to dive in and have a
            go. Artificial Intelligence is a huge paradigm change in the industry and all developers
            owe it to themselves to experiment in and familiarize themselves with the technology. 
            CodeProject SenseAI was built as a learning tool, a demonstration, and a library and 
            service that can be used out of the box.</li>
        <li>To make AI development easy. It's not that AI development is that hard. It's that
            there are so, so many options. Our architecture is designed to allow any AI 
            implementation to find a home in our system, and for our service to be callable from 
            any language.</li>
        <li>To focus on core use-cases. We're deliberately not a solution for everyone. Instead 
            we're a solution for common day-to-day needs. We will be adding dozens of modules 
            and scores of AI capabilities to our system, but our goal is always clarity and 
            simplicity over a 100% solution.</li>
        <li>To tap the expertise of the Developer Community. We're not experts but we know a
            developer or two out there who are. The true power of CodeProject SenseAI comes from 
            the contributions and improvements from our AI community.</li>
    </ul>
